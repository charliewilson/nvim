# Personal NeoVim Config

Based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim),
this is my personal NeoVim configuration.

It's changing all the time as I'm getting more to grips with it,
but it should always function as a like-for-like version of the LazyVim
starter template - so you can refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)
if you want to use this for your personal config as well.
